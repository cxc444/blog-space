            <h1>Narrative Drafting</h1>
            <br>
<div class="c7"><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c3">Narrative 3 Paragraphs Rough Draft</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c3">Intro:</span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c2 c0">The turn of the 20th century brought massive changes to our world as we know it. From mass production of consumer goods, advancements in modern medicine, science, technology, and more. This also meant new advancements in global warfare, such as the atomic bomb. One development in particular that shifted wartime strategies was Germany’s use of U-Boat submarines in the first and second world war. &nbsp;It is important to note that U-Boats mainly patrolled on the surface of the water, but had the ability to submerge underwater and cruise at lower speeds. These U-Boats were used to disrupt trade routes between the US and allies via the act of “ship hunting”, as well as engaging in several battles with naval vessels around the world. Our project focuses on how U-Boats affected maritime activity off the New Jersey coast and provoked new technological developments such as radar and sonar. &nbsp;We analyzed the dataset made available by the New Jersey Maritime Museum, which contains around 4500+ entries of shipwrecks off of the New Jersey Coast. This dataset includes shipwrecks from 1705-2013; 308 years of shipwrecks that include both purposeful sinking of ships for the artificial reef, and other ships that were wrecked due to various or unknown reasons. The dataset contains five data points that detail German U-Boats operating off the coast of New Jersey during WWI and WWII. These U-Boats torpedoed a number of ships listed in the database, as well as many others around the world. In addition to the data set, we have gathered a number of sources, primarily from a naval standpoint, that document how U-Boats were combatted and strategies developed in response. Through our project, we aim to clarify what impacts the U-Boats had on technological advancements of the time, naval strategy, trade/commerce, and overall maritime activity.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c3">Place in Literature:</span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c2 c0">Within the literature and information provided so far, it has been consistent with the documentation of the German U-Boats engaging in activities in the Atlantic Ocean and off of the New Jersey Coast. There is an abundant amount of information that is presented through books, articles, archives, photographs, military documents and more. In particular the US Navy released documents about German U-Boat activities in the Atlantic involving the United States and Canada. It documents U 151, one of the U-boats in the dataset, providing information on how long it took to travel from Germany to the Atlantic coast and vice versa. It covers a variety of topics, counter tactics, the effects on the maritime economic activities in the Atlantic Coast. This in depth set of information gives us access to understand why German U-Boats wanted to come to the East Coast and why it attacked the ships it did. The information from the US Navy also includes the ships that the U 151 sunk, which are also included in the dataset. Each ship is explored in detail on how it was sunk and how it impacted the activities of the US East Coast. The included photos help give context and visualization to the information that is being presented. It is important to note that U 151 was the only German U-Boat to be documented from World War I and was the first German U-Boat to breach US waters since the War of 1812.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, British and Canadian naval history sources go into detail regarding the use of the Enigma encoder, part of the Allied intelligence project </span><span class="c0 c1">Ultra</span><span class="c0 c2">, that was used to break Nazi code in order to anticipate their positions and strategies. It is argued in these sources that no discussion of this topic would be valid without considering the influence of Ultra on allied strategies and their inevitable triumph in WWII. This technique allowed for allied forces to intercept German transmissions and pinpoint German U-Boats in an attempt to destroy the fleets. Additionally, it could be stated that the covert nature of German U-Boat warfare may have encouraged or even provoked the production of this technology. In addition, high frequency direction finding and radar were especially effective in countering the elusive U-Boats. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As German U-Boats changed tactics and became more elusive, Allied ships began to have a challenge in honing to find them. Douglas M. McClean expands on the advancement of German U-Boat technology in his article </span><span class="c0 c1">Confronting Technological and Tactical Change: Allied Antisubmarine Warfare in the Last Year of the Battle of the Atlantic.</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;He states, “The new equipment that allowed this dramatic change in U-boat tactics was the schnorkel. This was a comparatively simple device that provided the boats enough air to operate their diesel engines while submerged.” This advancement in technology made it difficult for Allied forces to detect. The invention of the schnorkel made it possible for German U-Boats to evade the Allied forces because the “head of most schnorkels [were] fitted with a detection device that gave warning of the approach of Allied radars.” With being able to detect the approach of Allied forces they had the capability to deep dive into the ocean undetected. Those German U-Boats that were fitted with schnorkels used their detection abilities to engage with non-military vessels, such as shipping vessels. The decision to operate German U-Boats in coastal waters created an effect on maritime activities along the East Coast. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sources we have gathered, in concordance with the dataset, will allow us to estimate what sort of losses were incurred as a result of ship hunting by German U-Boats. Additionally, this can be used to investigate other effects that might have occurred due to this practice. </span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c2 c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Significance</span><span class="c2 c0">:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first major event in the timeline of U-Boat history was Black Sunday, on June 2, 1918. This was the first time that the Germans attacked American cargo ships. On this day, the U-151 sunk six ships and damaged two or more, including the liner </span><span class="c0 c1">SS Carolina</span><span class="c0">, &nbsp;freighters </span><span class="c0 c1">Winneconne</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0 c1">Texel</span><span class="c0">, and the schooner</span><span class="c0 c1">&nbsp;Isabel B. Wiley</span><span class="c0">. Before sinking them, the U-151 fired off warning shots and allowed people to exit the vessels beforehand. The combined crew and passengers were about 448 people, and the casualties were 13 people, due to one of the SS Carolina’s lifeboat’s capsizing. This was the first time that German U-Boats inhabited US waters off the East Coast, and the first foreign naval attack near the US border since the War of 1812. </span></p><p class="c6 c9"><span class="c2 c8"></span></p></div>
