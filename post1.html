            <h3>(700-1000 words) Reflecting on the readings from weeks one & two, write a "listicle" style article with 10 numbers points that answers the following questions: What is digital humanities? And so what? Why do I care?  Make sure to cite the literature and highlight key concepts and terms. 
            </h3>
            <p>

                1. Digital Humanities is the intersection between the humanities and computer science. It involves using modern computation techniques to answer traditional humanities questions. In Digital_Humanities, the authors state that “The suit of expressive forms now encompasses the use of sound, motion graphics, animation, screen capture, video, audio, and the appropriation and the remixing of code that underlies game engines.” Just as humanists would use a written essay or an article to share an idea or a piece of research, modern technology opens up new ways to communicate and facilitate discussion. It was in the early 1990s that the creation of the Web allowed for more collaboration to be done on this important work. Later on, the introduction of a GUI, or Graphical User Interface, allowed for the development of new, expressive media forms among the work of Digital Humanists. According to the authors of Digital_Humanities, these new tools and methods of working with data could be called “theory in practice” that needed time to grow and mature beyond the confines of the old print-based world.
                <br>
                2. Design/Visualization: Since Digital Humanities embraces aspects of multimedia and design, the work being done in the field often involves parts of other disciplines. In this way, Digital Humanities is often a team effort with members collaborating across different tasks and work dedicated to their research. Elements of graphic design and GUI implementation are essential in the field as data visualization allows for stories to be told through data/research in new and fascinating ways. 
                <br>
                3. Curation, according to the authors of Digital_Humanities is one of the fundamental activities at the core of the Digital Humanities field. Curation involves archives, collections, repositories, and other aggregations of materials. Its function within Digital Humanities is an interpretive framework or exhibit to display the selection and organization of materials. 
                <br>
                4. Analysis corresponds to the processing of text or data. This is one of the four fundamental activities of Digital Humanities. Before generating works in the field of Digital Humanities, the researchers involved must first understand and analyze the data set for what it is. All angles and perspectives regarding the data set, as well as ones that may be not included or taken into account, must be explored before beginning generative work. Otherwise, the research that occurs after analysis may be skewed or biased towards one viewpoint.
                <br>
                5. Editing, another of the four fundamentals, is productive and generative within the field of Digital Humanities. Not only is editing the cultural record important to the humanities field, it is also inherent to the process of creating multimedia representations of work done in the field of Digital Humanities. With digital technology, we are largely able to correct any mistake that we may make while creating, so the process of editing often occurs alongside or in congruence with the creative process.
                <br>
                6. Modeling, the last of the four fundamentals, highlights the notion of content models. This helps shape arguments that are conveyed in information structures and their designs. The authors in Digital_Humanities point out that “a digital project is an expression of assumptions about knowledge: usually domain-specific knowledge given an explicit form by the model in which it was designed.” 
                <br>
                7. Metadata, put simply, is data about data. According to Understanding Metadata by Jenn Riley, metadata is the key to the functionality of systems that hold content which helps users find items of interest, recording essential information about the items and also sharing the information with others. Boiled down, it is the who, what, when, where, why, and how. Metadata is inherent in all digital platforms that users interact with. The nature of the metadata that is generated depends on the purpose for taking that data. For example, if you enter a Google search for a popular chain store or restaurant, Google may use the metadata produced from the search that is pertaining to location in order to give the user a more relevant search output. 
                <br>
                8. Variability is inherent with collecting data. For instance there are patterns within the data but there is also randomness that may occur. In Data Points by Nathan Yau, he gives the example of a German physicist taking long-exposure photos of fireflies. The fireflies create a randomness in their movements while still going from point A to point B (the pattern). By using the data he creates, the flight path of the fireflies can nearly be calculated with accuracy, but it is the randomness and variability which you cannot predict. Variability should always be considered when looking at data sets but not solely focused on. 
                <br>
                9. Uncertainty should be considered when working with data that includes estimates based on a sample population. There should always be a level of uncertainty when analyzing data because if you don’t consider you may not understand what your data truly represents. Without uncertainty it is easier to misinterpret your data and portray a different perspective when presenting the data. 
                <br>
                10. Context is highly important within Digital Humanities. As Nathan Yau points out, “[context] can completely change your perspective on a dataset, and it can help you decide what the numbers represent and how to interpret them.” When looking at the data you have to understand the metadata before knowing what numbers actually represent.
