            <p class="tab">The Shipwrecks of New Jersey is a data set provided by the New Jersey Maritime Museum and presents an overview of shipwrecks off the shores of the state. This data set has set its focus off the coast of New Jersey as well as the Delaware Bay and River. To determine the cause and details regarding most of these wrecks, information such as newspaper stories, diaries, ship logs, books, periodicals, and more were used as well as working with collections from divers and public historians focusing on New Jersey maritime history. The data set has 4722 entries of shipwrecks from 1705-2013, a 308 year period, including a variety of data points and categories such as the ship name, ship type, date lost, cause of loss, cargo on the ship, and another 31 data points regarding miscellaneous information about the ship. 
            </p>    <br>
                <p class="tab">The data set has inconsistencies with regard to the date lost, ship name, and year that distinguishes it from other ships of the same name. For example, in 1812 there was a ship called the Eliza that was lost. The year and month was recorded, but the day of the disappearance was not. Many other entries have issues or uncertainties with the ship’s owner, year built, and where it was built. Some columns of data were left blank intentionally as they were unknown. The exact coordinates of many of the ships were not recorded either. Presumably, because some of these shipwrecks are so old, they weren’t able to determine the cause of many of them. Since this data stretches back over 300 years, our research team may need to focus on a certain timeframe or style of ship, cargo, technological advancement, etc. In the misc. category there are certain shipwrecks whose exploration is sponsored by organizations such as the Artificial Reef Association. This provides an avenue for exploring specific shipwrecks, and the motive behind their voyages. Is it possible that these seafarers were putting their lives at risk for the interests of a greater organization with certain agendas?
                </p><br>
                <p class="tab">Another area of ambiguity in the data set is the value of the cargo on the ships and the ships themselves. There is no disclaimer as to whether the values are adjusted for current inflation, or if that was the value at the time the ship was lost or wrecked. For this reason, we are left to assume that the values recorded were that of the time of the ship going missing. Other areas of uncertainty in the data set include that most ships were being built during the 19th century, despite the data set including ships that were lost during the 1700s, with the exception of six data points of ships built that dates back to 1753-1781. While there are many inconsistencies within the data set it ultimately has a bounty of information to analyze.
                </p><br>
                <p class="tab">With the mass amount of data over the 300 year period and the 4722 individual ships that our data set contains information on, there is still more that could be learned. The limitations of the data raises the question of verifiability of the sources and whether or not information was reported correctly. Analyzing the data critically with the information known about the data set and taking into account the inconsistencies and mass amount of data will help set a focus in conducting research. Looking at bias, collection methods, variability in data, and other uncertainties will assist in keeping a focus while researching and will be a challenge to visualize and design. Understanding the context behind the data is important when starting and diving further into our research as we can expect that it will affect our outcomes.
